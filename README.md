# 🎪 The World's Most Intentionally Terrible Website 🎪

Welcome to digital chaos! This website was created for the "Borked UI Challenge" - a celebration of everything that makes web design terrible, frustrating, and hilariously broken.

## 🔥 Features (or Bugs?)

### Visual Nightmares
- 🌈 **Eye-Melting Color Scheme**: A gradient background that shifts between neon pink, yellow, green, and cyan
- 🎨 **Comic Sans Everywhere**: The most beloved/hated font in web design
- ✨ **Rainbow Text**: Because subtlety is overrated
- 💫 **Spinning Header**: For that extra touch of nausea

### Annoying Interactions
- 🏃 **Runaway Button**: Try to click it... if you can catch it
- 📝 **Form from Hell**: 
  - Name must be EXACTLY 7 characters
  - Only accepts @aol.com emails
  - Password must contain emoji 🔐
  - CAPTCHA answer is 5 (not 4!)
  - Random chance to reset on every keystroke
- 🎯 **Floating Navigation**: Moves around the screen because why not?
- 👻 **Random Popups**: "You're our 1,000,000th visitor!"

### Useless Features
- 🎪 **Buttons That Do Nothing**: Download More RAM! Free iPad! Hot Singles!
- 🌀 **Spinning Emojis**: Customer testimonials have never been so dizzy
- 👻 **Falling Emojis**: Random emojis fall from the sky
- 🎨 **Cursor Trail**: Rainbow particles follow your mouse
- 📜 **Auto-Scrolling Text**: You can't stop it

### Hidden "Features"
